# GAMEPLAY DESIGN

How is the game actually played?

    -Maps
        -Store Levels
    -Levels
        -Store numpy array of blockID's to render the background
        -Stores List for Entities
            - Enemies and NPC's
        -Stores List for Tile-Entities
            - Tiles that can be interacted with
        - Quadtrees should be helpful here
    - The Map won't handle the player character in any capacity
