This folder contains the layout for how the items, npcs and whatnot should work.

Current item design:
Items are in a big json file and have names which work like this:

<person's> <legendary/epic/unusual/rare/default/poor> <adjective> <item> [of the] <profession>
Legendary's have all the flavour text. 3X Stats
Epics have everything except the owner. 2X Stats
Unusuals have everything except [of the professions] 3d3+3 on a random stat ( of all stats)
rares only have adjectives +1 every stat
defaults are only the item / sameboys
poors have bad adjectives -1 every stat


Consumables
<delicious/tasty/bountiful/doubious/default/rotten/sour>
<person's> <class> <item>

Delicious has names, 2x Stats, 2X Charges
Tasty, 2x stats
bountiful 2x charges
doubious 2 random additional stats , 3d3-6
rotten -2 every stat
sour -1 every stat
