This folder contains the layout for how the items, npcs and whatnot should work.

Current item design:
Items are in a big json file and have names which work like this:

<person's> <legendary/epic/unusual/rare/default/poor> <adjective> <item> [of the] <profession>
Legendary's have all the flavour text.
Epics have everything except the owner.
Unusuals have everything except [of the professions]
rares only have adjectives
defaults are only the item
poors have bad adjectives
