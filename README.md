# Kanata Quest

Kanata Quest is rougelike dungeon crawler game which was meant to be the final project for me
and Tharidu's CMPUT 274 course. But the game got too complicated to finish in a reasonable amount
of time when we had lots of other assignments and schoolwork to attend to.

This will eventually be finished, probably, but for now KanataQuest is a twinkle of an idea in
a couple madmen's eyes.

Heavily inspired by Axu. A brilliant game which you can pick up from itch.io
